# Fit-java-app
A very basic Java application that was created with the intention to highlight the simplicity of applying Fit tests to any project. I've created a simple employee class that contains a few basic Hibernate annotations. Through the use of Fit, I can write tests using simple HTML tables that will test whether the Hibernate validation rules are hit when creating a new Employee.

# What is Fit?
Fit is a tool for enhancing collaboration in software development. It's an invaluable way to collaborate on complicated problems--and get them right--early in development.
Fit allows customers, testers, and programmers to learn what their software should do and what it does do. It automatically compares customers' expectations to actual results.

# How does it work?
The project uses Re-fit, an adaptation of the original Fit framework which acts as a wrapper around any Fit tests allowing them to be identified as a JUnit. This makes running Fit tests even easier and is super handy if you are wanting to run Fit tests against an application via CI/CD.
